# lbtetrix
Tetris clone using perl gtk2

This is yet another Tetris clone. Nothing special here.
Developed using PERL and GTK2 and CAIRO

This is a work in a progres, it is fairy advanced, you can play, but I 
would like to improve the user interface and make it a bit less ugly.

You can play it with:
  perl lbtetrix.pl

Any suggestions, ideas or bug reports are welcome
